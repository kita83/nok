# nok

üöß This project is under active development and not ready for production use.

nok is a minimalist, terminal-based virtual office tool that allows distributed teams to feel present, reachable, and casually connected ‚Äî all from the command line. Inspired by the simple act of knocking on a door, nok brings presence awareness and real-time communication to remote-first teams, one gentle "kon kon" at a time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

* **Terminal UI (TUI)**: Lightweight, retro feel that blends into developer workflows using ratatui
* **Knock to Notify**: Send a subtle "knock" (sound + ASCII animation) to others
* **Presence Indicators**: See who is available, away, or offline in real time
* **Quick Commands**: `nok @user` ‚Äî fast and human
* **Single-line Display**: Optimized to work in height-constrained terminals
* **Tab Switching**: View switching with r (rooms), u (users), c (chat) keys
* **Voice Readout**: Optional text-to-speech feature that reads messages aloud ‚Äî bridging the gap between chat and casual voice presence
* **Command Mode**: Enter command mode with `i` key to send messages, join rooms, etc.
